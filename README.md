# Query Workbench
This application was originally motivated by my need to get the .NET-deserialized XML content of a SQL Server field for investigation purposes. Copying to Clipboard via the Results pane of SQL Management Studio was not only limited to a certain number of characters, but the deserialized value also contained escaped characters which resulted to malformed XML. I initially edited the pasted text manually but knowing that this particular investigation was something that I'll be doing for quite some time, I decided to automate the process. I created a small Windows Forms application which ran the query and bound the XML field value to a textbox, which surprisingly removed the escaped characters automatically.
